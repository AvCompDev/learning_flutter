# learning_flutter
This is my first repository on Git-Hub
👋 Hi, I’m @AvCompDev - Jerry
👀 I’m interested in turning new ideas into usable apps, programs and websites.
🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on future adventures once I am fluent in Flutter. Say that 10 times fast!
